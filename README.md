# Explanation for YOLOv5 Code

<b>YOLOv5 Overview:</b> YOLOv5, is a sophisticated object detection system renowned for its accuracy and quickness. Instead of sifting through different areas of the image, it processes the full image at once to detect things in real time. YOLOv5 is widely utilized in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and video surveillance since it is simple to deploy.

<b>Code Explanation (YOLOv5): </b><br>

<b>Installation: </b> <br>
To start, the libraries for deep learning and image processing are installed: torch, torchvision, and opencv-python. To use the trained model, a clone of the YOLOv5 GitHub repository is created.<br>

<b>Model Loading: </b><br>
The pre-trained YOLOv5s (small version) model is loaded from the Ultralytics GitHub repository using the torch.hub.load() function.<br>

<b>Video Processing: </b><br>
OpenCV's cv2 is used to capture the input video.Use VideoCapture(). Basic video metadata is extracted, including frame rate (FPS), frame width, and frame height.<br>

<b>Object Detection: </b><br>
Processing is done on the video frame by frame. The YOLOv5 model finds items in each frame and provides the names and bounding box coordinates. This label (label 32) identifies basketballs. The discovered object is surrounded by a rectangle, and the frame shows the object's confidence score.<br>

<b>Frame Display: </b><br>
Using cv2.cvtColor(), each processed frame is converted to RGB for display in a Jupyter notebook. It is then saved as an image and shown using IPython.display in the notebook.<br>

<b>YOLOv8 Overview:</b><br>
The newest member of the YOLO object detection family, YOLOv8, offers even greater speed, accuracy, and user-friendliness. By offering a more effective model architecture, an optimized training pipeline, and greater support for complex tasks like segmentation and classification, it outperforms YOLOv5.<br>

<b>Code Explanation (YOLOv8):</b>

<b>Installation:</b> <br>The YOLOv8 model is included in the installed ultralytics library, which simplifies use without requiring a manual clone of the GitHub repository.<br>

<b>Model Loading:</b><br> The YOLO() class from the ultralytics package is used to load the YOLOv8 tiny model (yolov8s.pt). This model is intended for applications involving quick object identification.<br>

<b>Video Processing:</b><br> The input video is taken, just like in the YOLOv5 code, and OpenCV is used to extract data like FPS, frame width, and height.<br>

<b>Object Detection:</b><br>The YOLOv8 model is used to process each video frame individually. Bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores are extracted for every frame. Similar to YOLOv5, when basketballs (label 32) are found, a rectangle is drawn around them, along with a confidence score.<br>
 
<b>Frame Display:</b><br> The frame is processed, stored as an image, and then used with the IPython.display module in the notebook to display. The code is organized similarly to the YOLOv5 example, however YOLOv8 has made some minor efficiency and usability enhancements.<br>
